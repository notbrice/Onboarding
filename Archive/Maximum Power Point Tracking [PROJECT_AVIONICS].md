# Maximum Power Point Tracking 
This project involves creating an algorithm based Maximum Power Point Tracking system.

## Background
MPPT or Maximum Power Point Tracking is used with inconsistent power sources (such as our CubeSat's solar power) to maximise energy output. 

The fundamental relationship of Power (W), Voltage (V), and current (I) is P = V * I. The graph below is an example of the relationship between current and voltage drawn from the solar panels. To determine the maximum power output occurs when P = V*I is a maximum.

Currently, PAST is using a regulator with built-in MPPC to achieve Maximum Power Point Conversion. While this is more reliable, it is less efficient than using Maximum Power Point Tracking using an algorithm. In the future, PAST it may
be beneficial for PAST to use MPPT for more power-demanding missions.

## Project Deliverables
1. Research and understand methods of Maximum Power Point Tracking, including the difference between MPPT and MPPC, creating an overview in your logbook.
2. List the trade-offs of MPPC vs MPPT for CubeSats in a table.
3. Investigate different MPPT algorithms (e.g. Perturb and Observe) and explain it in your logbook, with appropriate diagrams.
4. Create a simulation to verify the control algorithm works (you can use MATLAB/Simulink or a language of your choice).
5. Design a PCB to test your algorithm. It should include a microcontroller, appropriate sensors and control regulators.
6. Turn your algorithm into embedded software to use on the microcontroller.
